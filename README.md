# Feyn

A video-first learning platform built on the Feynman principle.  
**Stack**: Next.js 14 → static export → Netlify · No backend required.

---

## Quick Start (Local)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Deploy to GitHub + Netlify

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/feyn.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Connect to Netlify

1. [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com) → **Add new site → Import an existing project**
2. Select your GitHub repo
3. Build settings are auto-detected from `netlify.toml` (build: `npm run build`, publish: `out`)
4. Click **Deploy site**

Every push to `main` triggers a redeploy automatically.

---

## Using the Admin Panel

Go to `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin` (or `http://localhost:3000/admin` locally).

**Default password**: `feyn2024`  
→ Change it in `pages/admin.js`, line 6: `const ADMIN_PASSWORD = '...'`

### Workflow

1. Open `/admin` → enter password
2. Add/edit **Coaches** in the left panel first
3. Build your tree: **Programs → Subjects → Topics → Lessons**
4. For each lesson, paste the YouTube video ID and add a duration
5. Click **Generate courses.js** at the top right
6. Copy the output → paste into `data/courses.js` in your editor
7. `git add . && git commit -m "update courses" && git push`
8. Netlify redeploys in ~30 seconds ✓

The admin panel auto-saves your work-in-progress to `localStorage` so you won't lose it between sessions.

## Adding Coaches

Each coach needs an entry in `data/courses.js` under `coaches`:

```js
{
  id: "coach-slug",
  name: "Coach Name",
  title: "Lead Instructor",
  bio: "Short bio here.",
  avatar: "/coaches/name.jpg",       // place image in /public/coaches/
  signature: "/coaches/name-sig.png", // place signature PNG in /public/coaches/
  socials: {
    youtube: "https://youtube.com/@...",
    website: "https://..."
  }
}
```

Then reference coaches by their `id` in subjects and topics via `coachIds: ["coach-slug"]`.

## URL Structure

```
/                                               → Home
/profile                                        → User profile & progress
/coaches/himel                                  → Coach page
/hsc/math                                       → Subject page
/hsc/math/linear-algebra                        → Topic page
/hsc/math/linear-algebra/what-is-a-vector       → Lesson + video
/admin                                          → Admin panel (password protected)
```

---

## Data Structure

Everything lives in `data/courses.js`. Key fields:

```
Program
  └── Subject  (certificate: true/false, coachIds: [...])
        └── Topic  (coachIds: [...])
              └── Lesson  (videoId, duration, title, description)
```

## Migrating to a Real Backend (future)

All user data logic is isolated in `lib/userStore.js`.  
To swap localStorage for Supabase/Firebase: reimplement the same exported functions — nothing else in the app needs to change.

Functions to reimplement: `getProfile`, `saveProfile`, `clearProfile`, `getEnrolled`, `isEnrolled`, `enroll`, `unenroll`, `getProgress`, `markWatched`, `unmarkWatched`, `isWatched`, `getSubjectProgress`, `getTopicProgress`, `getCerts`, `hasCert`, `issueCert`
